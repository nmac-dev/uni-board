This is the CL argument for the server  
`python manage.py < command >`

Run these commands when you add/remove/move any django files  
`makemigrations`  
`migrate`  

Starts the server in the current terminal  
`runserver`  

Create a super user that can be access in the "/admin" page  
`createsuperuser`  

Creates a new "app" (kinda like a module) in the src directory  
`startapp < appname >`  

Load an admin user with username and password "admin", and loads in example posts  
`loaddata test_data.json`

`test`  
### IBM Cloud
Build container image with docker, upload to IBM cloud registry, then deploy container to Kubernetes.  
This can all be done in one step using the ibm_reimage bash script found under uni-board. Ensure you are logged in to IBM Cloud (`ibmcloud login`), then run `./ibm_reimage`. The external IP used to access the site will be displayed after the ./ibm_reimage script is run. To access the site, visit [external IP]:8080 in your browser.
